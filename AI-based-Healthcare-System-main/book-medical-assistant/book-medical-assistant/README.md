# 🧠 AI Healthcare Assistant

A multi-agent, modular AI assistant that integrates book discovery, medical imaging, lab diagnostics, and voice interaction into one cohesive system — built with Python.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project combines multiple components of an AI-driven medical assistant:
- 📚 **Book Recommender** – Finds relevant books/articles based on intent and context.
- 🧪 **Lab Assistant** – Handles lab diagnostics logic.
- 🧠 **Imaging System** – Analyzes medical images.
- 🎙️ **Speech Integration** – Converts speech to text and vice versa.
- 🤖 **LLM Agents** – Decision-making via LLM-integrated agents.
